Hello, 
Today I am learning how to use Git. It looks complex but seems very useful.

This is our task
Exercise:
Create a new folder within the ‘Actualize’ folder called ‘git_story’. It should have a file with a very short story (3 to 5 sentences). Turn it into a git repository, and make 3 changes, tracking each change with git.
